This repository has my attempts to get a handle on embedded rust. It's a project based on the [stm32f3 discovery](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html), 
as used in the [embedded](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/start/hardware.html) book and the [discovery](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/) book.

It probably shouldn't be used as an example!
